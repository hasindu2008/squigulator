 ***  Easy Multi-thread API *************************************************************************
 **************************************************************************************************/

/**************** This API is still in beta stage, there could be bugs *************************/

/*
This is a easy multi-thread API that can fetch a batch of slow5 records using multiple threads in parallel.
This API uses a fork-join thread model. It is not meant to be used by a programmer who has the expertise to write multi-threaded code and use the slow5 low-level API directly.
While fetching using this API would be faster than using a single thread, it would not be as efficient as using low-level API functions
directly from the programmer's own multi-threaded code. This API can be optimised using a thread pool, but that is not implemented yet.

that is they do superfluous mallocs and free and computations in cases which are unlikely to be bottlenecks
also each batch call will create and destruct threads rather than using a thread pool
